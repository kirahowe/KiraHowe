# Hello! I'm Kira

I've been writing software since 2016, experienced in full stack web development with a more recent focus on data processing and visualization tools. I also write easy-to-understand technical guides and tutorials for Clojure's data science ecosystem. My overarching goal is to steward the Clojure data science ecosystem into a state of stability and flourishing. A high-level roadmap tracking progress toward this end is available [on this project board](https://github.com/users/kiramclean/projects/4/).

If I could afford to work on open source full time I would, but I currently work full time for BroadPeak and spend whatever free time I can working on projects that benefit the Clojure community. If you find my work valuable please consider supporting me, either with a donation here or by sharing it with someone you know! You can find [updates about my open source work on my website](https://codewithkira.com/tags/oss-updates.html).

My main projects right now:
- [ggclj](https://github.com/kiramclean/ggclj) - Implementing the grammar of graphics in Clojure
- [Clojure Data Cookbook](https://github.com/scicloj/clojure-data-cookbook) - Creating a canonical resource on how to use Clojure's default data science stack, spawning many side quests in making that default stack production-ready along the way
- [Clojure Tidy Tuesdays](https://github.com/kiramclean/clojure-tidy-tuesdays/) - Beginner-level tutorials on how to use Clojure to accomplish basic data science tasks

You can read all about my adventures in coding (mostly with Clojure) on my [programming blog](https://codewithkira.com/).

I thrive in environments that champion open-source innovation, value community engagement, and are dedicated to solving complex problems with elegant, sustainable solutions. There are lots of things I typically help companies with:

- Do you have a ginormous code base that nobody can make sense of? I can help you organize it.
- Do you have stakeholders coming at you from every direction asking for different things? I can help you communicate with them to make a plan to actually build something.
- Do you have piles of data you want to get answers from? I can help you find them.
- Do you have a disproportionate number of early-career developers on your team you need to level up quickly? I can teach them.
- Do you want to build a culture of open collaboration and engage the global open source developer community but aren't sure where to start? I can help you transform your development processes.

I'm not currently seeking new opportunities but always love to meet other people working on interesting problems.
