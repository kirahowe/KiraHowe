# Hello! I'm Kira

I've been writing software since 2016, experienced in full stack web development with a more recent focus on data processing and visualization tools. I also write easy-to-understand technical guides and tutorials for Clojure's data science ecosystem. I work on open source software full time and pay my bills with money from grants and GitHub sponsors. If you find my work valuable please consider supporting it through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kiramclean).
