# Hello! I'm Kira

I've been writing software since 2016, experienced in full stack web development with a more recent focus on data processing and visualization tools. I also write easy-to-understand technical guides and tutorials for Clojure's data science ecosystem. I work on open source software full time and pay my bills with money from grants, GitHub sponsors, and contract work. If you find my work valuable please consider supporting it through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kiramclean) or reach out to me about working together!

I thrive in environments that champion open-source innovation, value community engagement, and are dedicated to solving complex problems with elegant, sustainable solutions. There are lots of things I can probably help you with:

- Do you have a ginormous code base that nobody can make sense of? I can help you organize it.
- Do you have stakeholders coming at you from every direction asking for different things? I can help you communicate with them to make a plan to actually build something.
- Do you have piles of data you want to get answers from? I can help you find them.
- Do you have a disproportionate number of early-career developers on your team you need to level up quickly? I can teach them.
- Do you want to build a culture of open collaboration and engage the global open source developer community but aren't sure where to start? I can help you transform your development processes.
